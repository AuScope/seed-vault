Introduction
============

Seismology services around the globe utilise the FDSN protocol, a well-defined free and open standard for
transmission and archiving of seismic waveform data, metadata, and earthquake information.

Unfortunately this only benefits those who have the software skills to wrangle with low-level HTTP requests and responses.

For the beginners, hobbyists and less software-savvy, the available pool of fully featured, open source, easy to use
GUI driven software tools is very limited.

To solve this problem we have created **seed-vault** an easy to use, open source GUI that has all the features required to access
and store seismic data.
